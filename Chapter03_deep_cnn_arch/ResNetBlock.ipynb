    "# Resnet\n",
    "In the previous section, we explored the Inception models, which had a reduced number of model parameters as the number of layers increased, thanks to the 1x1 convolutions and global average pooling. Furthermore, auxiliary classifiers were used to combat the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "ResNet introduced the concept of skip connections. This simple yet effective trick overcomes the problem of both parameter overflow and vanishing gradients. The idea, as shown in the following diagram, is quite simple. The input is first passed through a non-linear transformation (convolutions followed by non-linear activations) and then the output of this transformation (referred to as the residual) is added to the original input. Each block of such computation is called a residual block, hence the name of the model – residual network or ResNet.\n",

    "Using these skip (or shortcut) connections, the number of parameters is limited to 26 million parameters for a total of 50 layers (ResNet-50). Due to the limited number of parameters, ResNet has been able to generalize well without overfitting even when the number of layers is increased to 152 (ResNet-152). The following diagram shows the ResNet-50 architecture:\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of residual blocks – convolutional and identity, both having skip connections. For the convolutional block, there is an added 1x1 convolutional layer, which further helps to reduce dimensionality. A residual block for ResNet can be implemented in PyTorch as shown here"
