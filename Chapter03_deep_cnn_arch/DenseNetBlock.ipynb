    "The skip connections of ResNet connected the input of a residual block directly to its output. However, the inter-residual-blocks connection is still sequential, that is, residual block number 3 has a direct connection with block 2 but no direct connection with block 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "DenseNet, or dense networks, introduced the idea of connecting every convolutional layer with every other layer within what is called a dense block. And every dense block is connected to every other dense block in the overall DenseNet. A dense block is simply a module of two 3x3 densely connected convolutional layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These dense connections ensure that every layer is receiving information from all of the preceding layers of the network. This ensures that there is a strong gradient flow from the last layer down to the very first layer. Counterintuitively, the number of parameters of such a network setting will also be low. As every layer is receiving the feature maps from all the previous layers, the required number of channels (depth) can be fewer. In the earlier models, the increasing depth represented the accumulation of information from earlier layers, but we don't need that anymore, thanks to the dense connections everywhere in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key difference between ResNet and DenseNet is also that, in ResNet, the input was added to the output using skip connections. But in the case of DenseNet, the preceding layers' outputs are concatenated with the current layer's output. And the concatenation happens in the depth dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might raise a question about the exploding size of outputs as we proceed further in the network. To combat this compounding effect, a special type of block called the transition block is devised for this network. Composed of a 1x1 convolutional layer followed by a 2x2 pooling layer, this block standardizes or resets the size of the depth dimension so that the output of this block can then be fed to the subsequent dense block(s). The following diagram shows the DenseNet architecture:\n",
