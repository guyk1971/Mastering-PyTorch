    "# Building a transformer model for language modeling\n",
    "In this section, we will explore what transformers are and build one using PyTorch for the task of language modeling. We will also learn how to use some of its successors, such as BERT and GPT, via PyTorch's pretrained model repository. Before we start building a transformer model, let's quickly recap what language modeling is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewing language modeling\n",
    "Language modeling is the task of figuring out the probability of the occurrence of a word or a sequence of words that should follow a given sequence of words. For example, if we are given French is a beautiful _____ as our sequence of words, what is the probability that the next word will be language or word, and so on? These probabilities are computed by modeling the language using various probabilistic and statistical techniques. The idea is to observe a text corpus and learn the grammar by learning which words occur together and which words never occur together. This way, a language model establishes probabilistic rules around the occurrence of different words or sequences, given various different sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent models have been a popular way of learning a language model. However, as with many sequence-related tasks, transformers have outperformed recurrent networks on this task as well. We will implement a transformer-based language model for the English language by training it on the Wikipedia text corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's start training a transformer for language modeling.  \n",
    "**Note** A very similar pytorch tutorial can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transformer_tutorial.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will delve deeper into the various components of the transformer architecture in-between the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will need to import a few dependencies. One of the important import statements is listed here:\n",
    "Besides importing the regular torch dependencies, we must import some modules specific to the transformer model; these are provided directly under the torch library. We'll also import torchtext in order to download a text dataset directly from the available datasets under `torchtext.datasets`."

    "# Understanding the transformer model architecture\n",
    "This is perhaps the most important step of this exercise. Here, we define the architecture of the transformer model.\n",
    "\n",

    "The first thing to notice is that this is essentially an encoder-decoder based architecture, with the Encoder Unit on the left (in purple) and the Decoder Unit (in orange) on the right. The encoder and decoder units can be tiled multiple times for even deeper architectures. In our example, we have two cascaded encoder units and a single decoder unit. This encoder-decoder setup essentially means that the encoder takes a sequence as input and generates as many embeddings as there are words in the input sequence (that is, one embedding per word). These embeddings are then fed to the decoder, along with the predictions made thus far by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the various layers in this model:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding Layer**: This layer is simply meant to perform the traditional task of converting each input word of the sequence into a vector of numbers; that is, an embedding. As always, here, we use the `torch.nn.Embedding` module to code this layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Positional Encoder**: Note that transformers do not have any recurrent layers in their architecture, yet they outperform recurrent networks on sequential tasks. How? Using a neat trick known as positional encoding, the model is provided the sense of sequentiality or sequential-order in the data. Basically, vectors that follow a particular sequential pattern are added to the input word embeddings.These vectors are generated in a way that enables the model to understand that the second word comes after the first word and so on. The vectors are generated using the sinusoidal and cosinusoidal functions to represent a systematic periodicity and distance between subsequent words, respectively. The implementation of this layer for our exercise is as follows:"

    "As you can see, the sinusoidal and cosinusoidal functions are used alternatively to give the sequential pattern. There are many ways to implement positional encoding though. Without a positional encoding layer, the model will be clueless about the order of the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Head Attention**: Before we look at the multi-head attention layer, let's first understand what a self-attention layer is. We covered the concept of attention in Chapter 4, Deep Recurrent Model Architectures, with respect to recurrent networks. Here, as the name suggests, the attention mechanism is applied to self; that is, each word of the sequence. Each word embedding of the sequence goes through the self-attention layer and produces an individual output that is exactly the same length as the word embedding. The following diagram describes the process of this in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](B12158_05_02.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, for each word, three vectors are generated through three learnable parameter matrices (Pq, Pk, and Pv). The three vectors are query, key, and value vectors. The query and key vectors are dot-multiplied to produce a number for each word. These numbers are normalized by dividing the square root of the key vector length for each word. The resultant numbers for all words are then Softmaxed at the same time to produce probabilities that are finally multiplied by the respective value vectors for each word. This results in one output vector for each word of the sequence, with the lengths of the output vector and the input word embedding being the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "A multi-head attention layer is an extension of the self-attention layer where multiple self-attention modules compute outputs for each word. These individual outputs are concatenated and matrix-multiplied with yet another parameter matrix (Pm) to generate the final output vector, whose length is equal to the input embedding vector's. The following diagram shows the multi-head attention layer, along with two self-attention units that we will be using in this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](B12158_05_03.jpg)\n",

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Having multiple self-attention heads helps different heads focus on different aspects of the sequence word, similar to how different feature maps learn different patterns in a convolutional neural network. Due to this, the multi-head attention layer performs better than an individual self-attention layer and will be used in our exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, note that the masked multi-head attention layer in the decoder unit works in exactly the same way as a multi-head attention layer, except for the added masking; that is, given time step t of processing the sequence, all words from t+1 to n (length of the sequence) are masked/hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the decoder is provided with two types of inputs. On one hand, it receives query and key vectors from the final encoder as inputs to its (unmasked) multi-head attention layer, where these query and key vectors are matrix transformations of the final encoder output. On the other hand, the decoder receives its own predictions from previous time steps as sequential input to its masked multi-head attention layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Addition and Layer Normalization**: We discussed the concept of a residual connection in Chapter 3, Deep CNN Architectures, while discussing ResNets. In Figure 5.1, we can see that there are residual connections across the addition and layer normalization layers. In each instance, a residual connection is established by directly adding the input word embedding vector to the output vector of the multi-head attention layer. This helps with easier gradient flow throughout the network and avoiding problems with exploding and vanishing gradients. Also, it helps with efficiently learning identity functions across layers.Furthermore, layer normalization is used as a normalization trick. Here, we normalize each feature independently so that all the features have a uniform mean and standard deviation. Please note that these additions and normalizations are applied individually to each word vector of the sequence at each stage of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedforward Layer**: Within both the encoder and decoder units, the normalized residual output vectors for all the words of the sequence are passed through a common feedforward layer. Due to there being a common set of parameters across words, this layer helps with learning broader patterns across the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear and Softmax Layer**: So far, each layer is outputting a sequence of vectors, one per word. For our task of language modeling, we need a single final output. The linear layer transforms the sequence of vectors into a single vector whose size is equal to the length of our word vocabulary. The Softmax layer converts this output into a vector of probabilities summing to 1. These probabilities are the probabilities that the respective words (in the vocabulary) occur as the next words in the sequence.\n",
    "Now that we have elaborated on the various elements of a transformer model, let's look at the PyTorch code for instantiating the model."

Perplexity is a popularly used metric in natural language processing to indicate how well a probability distribution (a language model, in our case) fits or predicts a sample. The lower the perplexity, the better the model is at predicting the sample. Mathematically, perplexity is just the exponential of the cross-entropy loss.
